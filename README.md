# WhatsApp-bot-on-Python

Description:
Developed a Python-based WhatsApp automation bot that sends scheduled messages using the Twilio API. The bot takes user input for recipient number, custom message, and desired send time, then uses Pythonâ€™s datetime and time modules to schedule the message. This project enhanced my understanding of API integration, task automation, and real-time scheduling in Python. It demonstrates practical use of third-party services (Twilio) for building communication tools.

Tech Stack: Python, Twilio API, datetime, time
